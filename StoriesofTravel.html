	<h3>Introduction:</h3>
   <div id="journal">	
		<p>My name is Ean McFoley. I am currently a professional wrestler for the promotion Western Grizzly Wrestling. I’ve trained
		in kickboxing and grappling martial arts since I was a youngling, and have had many influences in my style of fighting. 
		I look forward to sharing those experiences with you; the reading audience. What I’m sharing, so graciously, with these 
		memoir entries are the stories throughout my life, and how they made me the man I am today. Many have mocked me, because 
		some of these accounts are too hard to believe. To be completely honest, I couldn’t care less what you do or do not believe. 
		I’m not responsible for all the people whose small-minded inability to grasp the idea of anything bigger than what lies in 
		front of their primitive eyes detracts them from the events in my life. I am open to criticism, of course, but I am also open 
		to the fact that most people I tell these stories to tend to be intimidated by the idea that there are existences outside of 
		what they thought possible. “The world is only intimidating as you let it be,” as Grandpa McFoley used to say. You’ll come 
		to find out that my philosophy is that you should take things as they come. There is no use in hiding from fears, emotions, 
		or eye-opening views of reality. Let the world be as it is and take on as many challenges as you can.</p> 
		
		<p>	Now for those of you whose open mind wants to explore the hidden underworld of what is really happening on around us all,
		then keep reading, and I hope you enjoy. I am a man who loves to entertain people and capture their attention. For those who
		know me, they understand that I’m constantly swearing and using every expletive word I know in my everyday dialect. However,
		I will do my best to not use that language while writing all of this. Although there is nothing wrong with so-called “curse 
		words”, I know there are parents out there who have problems with it and wouldn’t want their kids to read something that goes
		against their ideas of what proper people talk like. I look to tell these stories to let kids know they don’t have to stop
		adventuring, to let them know they can keep their minds open, still enjoy exploring all that is around them, and having fun
		in believing.  For that case, I will not use “dishonorable” language. 
		
		<p>Each journal entry will be a recollection of something that happened sometime in my past. It could be from my standpoint,
		or from a story I was told by one of friends. I can’t say any of these entries will have any message you can take away from 
		them, but I will let you know what I have learned from them.</p>
		
		<p>	Here is a very broad view of my past, so that when I am telling you a story you have a little bit to go off. From what
		I was told, my adopted parents had just been recently married. The women I consider my mother was a teacher at the time. 
		She had a met a man recently out of the army at one of her friend’s party. This man is the man I consider my father. 
		He was born in Adare, Ireland and when he was in his early teens, moved to America with his mother and three brothers. 
		He joined the army when he was in his 20’s and trained as a medic. Out of the army he went to school to finish up his 
		medical degree. The two were eventually married, and were going to the man’s native land to start off their honeymoon. 
		After a nice dinner, the two of them decided to visit St. Audoeon’s Church. As they would walk around the outside they 
		would hear a loud wail of a crying baby. To inspect the source of the sound they would come around to the front of the 
		church and see IT there.. There, on top of the stone steps, in front of the large wooden doors to the holy worship center 
		for Christians someone had left a child, in the most cliché way I have ever heard of, for the church to take care of. 
		Now I have a lot I could say about this, such as; Who leaves children outside of churches in the 20th century? Why not 
		just take the baby to a better church, or better yet, and actual orphanage? Whatever the reason, this baby was left in 
		front of these doors and this couple had just found him. The couple jumped the fence and approached the infant. 
		The women picked the baby from its carrier and did what she could to ease the baby’s temper. The man would eventually 
		notify the local authorities and the kid would be put in protective care for abandoned children. The couple would 
		continue their honeymoon, but in their minds loomed the idea of the baby that was left to the world without parents. 
		After a night over dinner the woman brought up to the man her thoughts of adoption, and after a long conversation 
		they would both agree on the idea. They would return to the orphanage the baby had been put in to see if it was still 
		there. It was, and they adopted it. I couldn’t tell you why the felt so passionate about this baby, or why they felt 
		so connected to it, but I am glad they did. You see, as you might have guessed, I was that baby.</p>
		
		<p>I wish I could tell all worked out from there for them, but that wouldn’t be an interesting story. They would
		move back to the United States. Their careers would eventually grasp tightly on their lives and require that the 
		both move to different places around the world constantly. My father became a medical instructor for the army and 
		was constantly moved around to different army out posts throughout the globe, and my mother moved from country to 
		country and state to state, so that she could improve her teaching abilities. They tried to stay married. They would 
		try to make it all work. At some point they would meet again, and my mother would become pregnant with what is now my 
		little sister. Their meets would start to get more spaced out. It would eventually get to the points were their meets
		were no longer romantic, but long nights of arguing. The inevitable eventually would happen and they would divorce.
		Personally, I was happy they would leave each other. They couldn’t make the other happy, and the love in their 
		relationship had burnt out. If that happens it will only cause everyone involved more suffering if you stay together.</p>
		
		<p>My sister and I would fly all over the globe. Living with each parent for a while. Due to this we were exposed 
		to the world around us and got to grow up and see all walks of life. Currently my mother lives in Reno, Nevada as 
		an administrator for	the local school district. That’s where I’m at now. I must say, it was weird writing such a 
		short story of why I’m here. I’m looking forward to telling you all the adventures that happened in all the places 
		I’ve lived and visited.</p>
